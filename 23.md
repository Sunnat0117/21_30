 Task-23 Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.


//Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters

// i don't understand

var myCountry = ` my frined\`s don\`t speak english `;
